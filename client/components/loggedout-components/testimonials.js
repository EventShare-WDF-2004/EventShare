        I used EventShare to plan my daughter’s graduation party and the event
        was perfect! I was able to set up tasks for her friends to bring special
        goodies and treats. Her sister created a poll to decide a themed dress
        code for all the guests. All through this app! We were able to track
        RSVPs and everyone was so excited and appreciated our stylish way to
        keep everything so organized. Now I’m waiting for the next great event
        to plan. Thank you EventShare!!! -Raji Allen

        With ease and simplicity, EventShare is an excellent app to use for all
        your event needs. Great for both the planner and the invitee! Would
        definitely recommend to my friends and family! -Janiece Regina
