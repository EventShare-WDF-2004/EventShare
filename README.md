                            EVENT SHARE

          ________________Events Made Easy________________

Planning an event, no matter how big or small, can become tedious at times. Our
app would facilitate the organization of these events by letting users manage the
logistics with others. The app can be used for any get-together, family reunions,
parties, among other activities.
